# Hackers Terminal

## Overview

Welcome to Hackers Terminal! This project is a simulation of a hacker terminal interface. Dive into the world of hacking with this stylish and interactive terminal experience.

## Project Structure

- **HTML File:** [`index.html`](index.html)

- **CSS File:** [`style.css`](style.css)

- **JavaScript File:** [`script.js`](script.js)

- **View Live:** [`Hacker-Terminal.com`](https://rahulp-here.github.io/my-web-dev-evolution.github.io/Project-7/index.html)

- **Description:** A simulation of a hacker terminal interface featuring glitch effects, dynamic text animations, and a staged hacking process.
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Contents

1. **Glitch Effect**
   - Utilizes CSS animations to create glitch effects on the terminal interface elements.
   - Glitch effect intensifies on user interaction.

2. **Dynamic Text Animations**
   - Implements JavaScript functions for dynamic text animations like typing effect and staged process updates.

> **Note:** This project also provides an excellent opportunity to practice asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript, particularly the `async/await` syntax. You can explore how asynchronous tasks are managed using `async` functions and `await` keywords throughout the codebase.

3. **Staged Hacking Process**
   - Simulates a staged hacking process with different phases such as file reading, data transmission, and cleanup.
   - Each stage is visually represented with dynamic text updates and glitch effects.
