There is a defference between querySelector/quesrySelecotrAll method and getElementById/getElementsByClassName

1. getElementById/getElementsByClassName: This method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the specified class name. It means that if the DOM is updated and new elements with the specified class are added or removed, the collection automatically updates to reflect these changes.

2. querySelector/quesrySelecotrAll: This method returns a static NodeList of elements that match the specified CSS selector. It doesn't update dynamically if the DOM changes after the initial selection.
